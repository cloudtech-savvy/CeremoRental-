          Think of it as a one-stop shop for party planning. On the platform,
          you'll find vendors who rent out everything you need for your
          ceremony, like chairs, tables, decorations, and even catering
          services. You can browse and compare options from different vendors,
          book what you need, and chat with them directly. Vendors, on the other
          hand, can list their available items, set their prices, manage
          bookings, and handle delivery and pickup. This platform streamlines
          the process for both sides, making planning and renting ceremony
          supplies easier and more convenient.

        <p className="legal-title">How it Works</p>
        <p className="legal-description">
          A ceremony rental platform connects people planning ceremonies (like
          weddings or parties) with vendors who rent out items needed for the
          event. Imagine it like an online marketplace: Party planners: Browse
          and search for items like chairs, tables, decorations, and even
          services like catering. They can compare prices and availability from
          different vendors, book the items they need, and communicate directly
          with the vendors. Rental vendors: List their available items and set
          their own rental prices. They manage their listings, confirm bookings,
          and deliver and pick up the rented items after the ceremony.
